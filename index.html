          <p>ScorePio uses the iPhone's built-in microphone to dynamically integrate music in to your TTRPG. The app analyzes the player's energy levels in real-time and adjusts the music to match.

        <h2>Dynamic Volume</h2>
        <h3>Microphone detects player energy and automatically adjusts levels.</h3>
        <p>The music will grow and shrink in real time along with the ebb & flow of your gameplay. As your players get more excited, the music will crescendo. Likewise, during the quietest moments of gameplay, the composition will shrink to only an instrument or two.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges of using music in your TTRPG is managing levels. A bombastic track during a quiet moment quickly breaks immersion. ScorePio attempts to solve this by arranging the music around your game.</p>

        <p>The Incantations feature allows you to create custom trigger words that, when detected by the microphone, play a specific sound effect. The video below demonstrates how to play a thunder sound effect whenever the word "thunder" is spoken.</p>

        <h2>Intelligent Combat Detection</h2>
        <p>When enabled, ScorePio can recognize when the game has entered combat. This is done using a Machine Learning engine that has been trained to identify words and phrases that are associated with combat in D&D.</p>
        <p>Combat detection is a lagging metric that may take a few minutes to reach a confidence threshold, but when triggered, playlists can be changed. The AI has been specifically trained to recognize combat in D&D 5th Edition with more games and scenarios planned for the future.</p>

      <h2>Current State</h2>
      <p>This app has been a passion project since 2019 with the goal of providing Game Masters a tool to more easily and effectively integrate music in to their games. Hundreds (likely thousands) of hours have been spent on this project and the next steps will require much more work and the help of more people. Before continuing, I want to share the idea with a small group of GMs for feedback and thoughts.</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking a look at this project. I sincerely appreciate any thoughts and opinions. The beauty of technology is that almost anything is possible. My main goal is to provide all games with the dynamic musical score they deserve.</p>

  <div class="minorSection" id="musicDirection">
    <div class="innerWrap">
      <h2>Music Direction</h2>
      <p>The vision for the music is to create both scenario music (combat, travel, tavern, etc.) and cultural music. I believe there is a lot of unexplored territory in developing the sound of each culture in D&D.</p>

  <div class="minorSection" id="biography">
    <div class="innerWrap">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello. Thanks for making it this far. I first started composing music at 15 as a member of the orchestral band, <a href="https://noxarcana.com" target="_blank">Nox Arcana</a>. In 2013, I moved to Los Angeles and had the opportunity to score and produce a couple of feature films. For the past six years, I have been primarily working as an engineer and producer with Ryan Ross (Panic! at the Disco).</p>
      <p>Fantasy games have always been an important part of my life. The idea for Nox Arcana originated from weekly video game sessions playing Might & Magic. Much of my childhood was dedicated to a Half-Elf ranger on the Brell Serilis server of Everquest or playing Magic: the Gathering. I also made myself a full chainmail shirt and coif to wear to the Great Lakes Ren Fair when I was in high school.</p>
      <p>After graduating with a degree in Visual Communication & Design from Kent State University, I worked for a few years building the front-end of Progressive.com. This app has been a passion project combining my passion for composing, code and fantasy games.</p>

  <div class="minorSection" id="ethics">
    <div class="innerWrap">
      <h2>Privacy & Ethics</h2>
      <p>Any use of the built-in microphone requires sensitivity and the ScorePio app does not and will not track its user's speech or game data. The dynamic music feature requires the user's permission to use the microphone, but only stores the audio for a fraction of a second. It does not detect speech. The Incantations (speech-triggered sound effects) and combat detection features both require speech detection to be enabled. This service sends audio data to Apple's server. Apple then returns the detected text, which is stored locally on the phone for a short amount of time (less than a few minutes), analyzed and then deleted. The text is never sent to a ScorePio or affiliated server.</p>
      <p>The music and app is the product and ScorePio will never sell a user's data.</p>

      <p>The ScorePio app has been developed using clips from Critical Role and LA by Night â I have listened to some scenes for countless hours on loop while dialing in the code.
